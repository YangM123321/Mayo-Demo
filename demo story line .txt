"Demo storyline (15–20 min)

Load & inspect

Show your read_mimic.py plots (HR histogram, Top-10 complaints).

In Neo4j Browser: run the “top complaints / patient ED visits / vitals timeline” queries you just ran.

FHIR alignment

Briefly show your transformation into FHIR (or your mapping plan). If you’re not pushing to HAPI yet, show the mapping code/matrix and one example resource.

API layer

Start FastAPI; demonstrate:

/remote/fhir/observations/by_loinc/{code} (or your current endpoints)

Optional: /predict endpoint that calls a baseline model.

ML baseline

Train a simple model (e.g., triage priority / 24h admission) on MIMIC-ED demo features.

Expose it through your FastAPI endpoint and show a live request/response.

Graph insights (Neo4j)

Show the graph view for one stay’s vitals chain and the “top complaints” query.

Mention that in production you’d run Graph Data Science (GDS) algorithms (communities, similarity) server-side.

Cloud-ready

Show your Dockerfile + requirements.txt.

Say you can deploy the same container to Cloud Run/EC2 and scale reads with BigQuery (see expansion below).

What to build next (if you go the “Mayo workflow” path)

Data model + validation

Lock a tidy schema (Pandas → pydantic or Great Expectations checks).

Add a small data dictionary (CSV/MD) so reviewers see columns ↔ FHIR ↔ graph nodes.

ETL to FHIR (optional but impressive)

Push a subset to HAPI FHIR (Patients, Encounters, Observations for a few LOINC codes).

Provide two example queries (Observation by LOINC; Encounter by date range).

Graph enhancement

Expand Neo4j nodes: Patient–EDStay–Vital–Complaint, optionally Lab or Diagnosis.

Add 2–3 “business questions” as Cypher (top complaints, frequent flyers, vitals trend per stay).

ML v1 (baseline, honest)

Features: last triage vitals, chief complaint text (bag-of-words or simple categories).

Target: admit vs discharge or triage acuity band.

Deliverables: cross-val metrics (AUROC, F1), confusion matrix plot, model.pkl, /predict endpoint.

Cloud packaging

Dockerize FastAPI (+ model + config).

Deploy to Cloud Run (or EC2). Add a Makefile or a one-pager with the deploy command.

Expansion to scale (your exact sentence included)

Document clearly in README:
“未来扩展：如果要展示处理‘超级多’的病例，我可以直接切换到更大的版本或者云端数据库（Google BigQuery），就像从一个小试吃装换成商店里的大桶。”
Concretely: keep the same pandas/SQL queries; only switch the data source string to BigQuery and show a query that scans millions of rows (with a LIMIT/aggregation to keep the demo snappy).

Which path to present to Dr. Tao?

Primary path: MIMIC-ED demo (what you just loaded) → plots → Neo4j insights → API → baseline ML → “cloud-ready” slide.

Backup path: Run the same pipeline end-to-end on Synthea (no credentials/privacy blockers). This proves portability.

🏥 4. Typical Mayo Clinic workflow
Build ETL pipelines to continuously load clinical data into Neo4j.


Use Cypher + GDS on servers or clusters—no human tries to view millions of nodes visually.


Analysts or clinicians sample subsets or aggregated dashboards for presentations (e.g., Bloom or PowerBI).


Full graph statistics or embeddings are generated programmatically, then summarized for decision-making.What to build next (if you go the “Mayo workflow” path)

Quick checklist (so you’re ready)
scripts/load_neo4j.py --source mimic loads without errors.


Three Cypher queries bookmarked in Browser (top complaints, frequent flyers, vitals timeline).


quick_plots.py pops two figures locally.


FastAPI runs and returns 200 for /health and one data endpoint.


A minimal model trains and serves a /predict request.


Docker build works locally; README shows Cloud Run deploy command.


README includes the BigQuery “big bucket” expansion line above.



 " Now, i uploaded the mimic data and can use it to quick plot and neo4j. whats next if i follow mayo workflow?
